        <p class="par">The object of the game is to expose all cards and move them to the foundation piles by assembling cards of the same suit in complete runs from King to Ace within the columns of the tableau. Once a complete run is made, the cards in that run are automatically moved to the foundation piles. When all completed runs have been moved from the tableau to the foundation piles, the game is won.</p>

        <p class="par">During game play, cards facing up may be moved between the columns of the tableau by building runs of cards downward in decreasing rank, for example:  4-3-2-A , 10-9-8-7-6, K-Q-J, etc. When building runs in the tableau, cards may be moved individually or in groups, and any suit can be placed on top of any other suit. However, only runs of cards that are in proper decreasing rank order and of the same suit may be moved together as a group. An empty column may be filled by any card or run of cards that are eligible to be moved.</p>

        <p class="par">Cards from the stock are dealt by tapping the stacks of cards representing the stock. Cards from the stock are dealt in sets of 10, one card to each column of the tableau. Cards may be dealt from the stock at any time as long as all of the tableau columns contain at least one card.</p>
